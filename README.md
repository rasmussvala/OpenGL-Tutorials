# The Cherno's OpenGL Tutorials
This repository is for practicing some of The Cherno's OpenGL tutorials. 

## Getting started 
If you want to get this repo up and running locally on your machine, you'll need to do the following:

1. Install Vcpkg. Here's a great [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-_vTMjcRzQ&t).
2. Install **glad** and **GLFW** with Vcpkg.
3. Create a solution using **CMake**. Choose **src** as the source folder and create your build folder.

I know I can simplify this process by creating a more sophisticated CMakeLists file, but this will have to do for now.
